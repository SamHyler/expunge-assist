# Record Clearance Project

Record Clearance is a project of Hack for LA. Hack for LA is a brigade of a Code for America that exists to help people clear their records in Californians. Record Clearance helps people with non-violent criminal records accomplish record clearance or expungement in California as a result of Prop 47. The projects' main features include building trust, educating the public about the program and informing those who are eligible for expungement.

## Project context

Record clearance or expungement in California is only possible as a result of [Prop 47](https://www.courts.ca.gov/prop47.htm). Our Google Drive for the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hBhOeNyjjEaHcWAKSu9eW--FF9HnKNqe) 

Historicly California has been trying to reduce the number of people in its prison system, and reduce reduce mandatory minimum sentencing for non-violent crimes, see [Prop 36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_California_Proposition_36), for first time or "non-career criminals".

## Installation instructions {TBA}

1. Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.
2. You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.
3. Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.
4. Alternatively, you can move everything from *Installation instructions* through *Testing* to a separate **Contributing.md** file to keep your **ReadMe.md** more succinct.


### Working with issues {TBA}

- Explain how to submit a bug.
- Explain how to submit a feature request.
- Explain how to contribute to an existing issue.

To create a new issue, please use the blank issue template (available when you click New Issue).  If you want to create an issue for other projects to use, please create the issue in your own repository and send a slack message to one of your hack night hosts with the link.
